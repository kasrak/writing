            I spent the past summer working on the iOS team at <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a>.
            This post is a recap of some of the things I worked on during my
            internship.
            </p>

            <p>
            Khan Academy is
            best known for their videos, but there are also hundreds of interactive
            math exercises students can use to practice skills
            ranging from counting to calculus. Here's what an exercise looks
            like on the website:
            </p>

            <div class="media-container center">
                <img src="http://dcv5tqec9187e.cloudfront.net/khan-internship/khan-website.png" width="720" height="437">
            </div>

            <p>
            For the past few months, the mobile team has been working to bring
            these exercises to the iPad app and I got to help!
            </p>
        </section>

        <section class="clearfix">
            <h2>Related videos</h2>

            <p>
            Most exercises have related videos that students can watch if they're stuck. My first project was to implement a native version of the related videos interface. We liked how the YouTube app lets you drag down a video to interact with other content, so that's what I started with.
            </p>

            <div class="media-container">
                <div class="media-caption big  right" style="width: 280px">
                    <p>
                    In the first prototype, the video stayed on a fixed track, using the finger's y-coordinate to interpolate the position on the track. This felt awkward on the iPad: if you didn't drag along the path, your finger's movement would become disconnected from the movement of the video.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    We also realized that always having a thumbnail on the screen would be a waste of precious pixels, especially since a lot of the thumbnails would be black rectangles with a few scribbles.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="video-player">
                    <div class="fake-ipad">
                        <video poster="http://dcv5tqec9187e.cloudfront.net/khan-internship/related-videos-0.png"
                               width="384" height="512"
                               loop>
                               <source src="http://dcv5tqec9187e.cloudfront.net/khan-internship/related-videos-0.webm"
                                       type="video/webm">
                               <source src="http://dcv5tqec9187e.cloudfront.net/khan-internship/related-videos-0.mp4"
                                       type="video/mp4">
                        </video>
                    </div>
                    <div class="play-button"></div>
                    <div class="pause-button"></div>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>
            So we played with having three states: hidden, maximized, and docked. The docked video would play the video in the corner, letting the student interact with the exercise while watching the video.
            </p>

            <div class="media-container">
                <div class="media-caption big right" style="width: 280px">
                    <p>
                    Since exercises can have multiple related videos, this version let the student swipe left and right to switch between the different videos in the maximized state.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    This prototype also allowed the video to be docked anywhere along the bottom of the screen. As we added more UI elements to the screen, we ended up pinning the docked video to the bottom right to make it more consistent.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="video-player">
                    <div class="fake-ipad">

                                       type="video/mp4">

                    <div class="play-button"></div>
                    <div class="pause-button"></div>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>I spent a lot of time playing with these prototypes. I noticed that if your finger wasn't centered in the video view when docking the video, the finger would become detached from the video as it shrunk, ruining the illusion of direct manipulation. I fixed this by setting the view's anchor point to the touch position, which makes the view shrink around the user's finger&mdash;a simple change that prevents limb-view detachment. See for yourself:</p>

            <div class="video-player">
                    <video poster="http://dcv5tqec9187e.cloudfront.net/khan-internship/related-videos-anchor-combined.png"

                                   type="video/mp4">
                    </video>
                    <div class="media-caption left half">
                        Before: Anchor point is always in the center of the video view.
                        The touch leaves the view as it shrinks.
                    </div>
                    <div class="media-caption right half">
                        After: Anchor point is set to the touch position.
                        The view resizes around the touch, so the
                        touch never leaves the view.
                    </div>
                    <div class="play-button" style="background-position-y: 200px"></div>
                    <div class="pause-button" style="background-position-y: 200px"></div>
            </div>

            <p>I tried implementing all of the animations between the different states with <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIDynamicAnimator_Class/index.html#//apple_ref/occ/cl/UIDynamicAnimator">UIDynamics</a>, but ended up switching to <a href="https://github.com/facebook/pop">POP</a> because UIDynamics doesn't provide an easy way to tell when animations have quiesced. As a bonus, POP made it pretty easy to have the animations be <a href="http://youtu.be/OiY1cheLpmI?t=43m35s">interruptible</a>.</p>

            <p>Plot twist! Most of this didn't make it into the app. When we tested with students, it wasn't clear that the fancy interactions were helpful. So we ended up shipping a simpler implementation without docking.</p>

            <h2>Scratchpad</h2>

            <p>My next project was to make a native version of the exercise scratchpad. A lot of students use the scratchpad on the website to do rough work, even though writing with
            a mouse can be painful, so we knew it was a valuable feature that could provide a far better experience on a touch device. This ended up being my biggest project.</p>

            <img src="http://dcv5tqec9187e.cloudfront.net/khan-internship/scratchpad-view-sandwich.png" width="182" height="160" class="scratchpad-view-sandwich">

            <p>It was decided early on during the development of the app that exercise content would be rendered in a web view&mdash;it was the only feasible way to bring hundreds of exercises with the resources we had. This meant the scratchpad canvas
            (a native view) would cover the webview rendering the exercise.</p>

            <p class="clear">This arrangement was complicated by the fact that all exercises have interactive regions. For example, in the exercise below, the blocks have to be dragged to put them in the correct order.</p>

            <div class="media-container center">
                <div class="fake-ipad">
                    <div class="video-player">
                        <video poster="http://dcv5tqec9187e.cloudfront.net/khan-internship/scratchpad-full.png"
                               width="512" height="254"
                               loop>
                           <source src="http://dcv5tqec9187e.cloudfront.net/khan-internship/scratchpad-full.webm"
                                   type="video/webm">
                           <source src="http://dcv5tqec9187e.cloudfront.net/khan-internship/scratchpad-full.mp4"
                                   type="video/mp4">
                        </video>
                        <div class="play-button"></div>
                        <div class="pause-button"></div>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>
            So the main problem boils down to hit testing: when the scratchpad
            is active and a touch starts, should we start drawing or let the webview
            handle the touch?
            </p>

            <p>
            After an initially-promising but ultimately sketchy solution that
            relied on internal implementation details of how native touches
            are handled when Javascript calls <code>e.preventDefault()</code>
            on the touch event, it became clear that the right way to do it would
            be to ask the webpage directly.
            </p>

            <p>
            Mark all interactive DOM elements with special class. Use elementFromPoint() to
            see if element or parent have the class.
            </p>

            <p>
            When a touch starts, scratchpad asks if there is an interactive element at
            the touch coordinates. But it can't block--this would drop the first few
            strokes (pretty high overhead of making a call into JS land). Particularly
            annoying for short strokes, like decimal points. So we queue up the touch
            points, but only start drawing when we receive response from webview.
            </p>

            <h3>Interaction Prototyping</h3>

            <p>
            I took a break from iOS land during the 4-day
            <a href="http://healthyhackathon.khanacademy.org/">Healthy Hackathon</a> and
            teamed up with <a href="https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak">Andy</a>
            and <a href="https://twitter.com/soprano">Ben</a> to work on a proof-of-concept
            for a UI prototyping tool. Having written way too much code to explore different
            interactions for the related videos, we wanted to explore how we could make iterating
            on interactive designs faster.
            </p>

            <iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/115821145" width="720" height="580"
                frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen>
            </iframe>

            <p>
            We built a visual editor that emits <a href="http://framerjs.com/">framer.js</a> code.
            Framer.js is a Javascript library that helps build interactive prototypes, but it can
            take a lot of fiddly code to get things where you want them. We tried to let the user
            set the scene visually, and only write code to describe the interactions.
            </p>

            <h3>UIWebView &rarr; WKWebView</h3>

            <p>
            After
            <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/WebKit/Reference/WKWebView_Ref/index.html"><code>WKWebView</code></a>
            was announced, I spent some time trying
            to make the app use it on iOS 8+ devices, while continuing
            to use <code>UIWebView</code> on iOS 7 devices.
            </p>

            <p>
            This involved converting all the communication between the app and webview to
            be asynchronous, since <code>WKWebView</code>'s API for calling
            Javascript functions from Objective-C is non-blocking.
            </p>

            <p>
            But when I actually ran the app on an iOS 8 device, nothing loaded. Womp-womp.
            That's because <code>WKWebView</code> can't load
            files directly from the local filesystem (this is probably <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=137153">going to be fixed</a>).
            Just for fun, I hacked up a version of the app with a local webserver to
            serve the local files. In brief unscientific testing (i.e. I just
            played around with some exercises), I didn't notice huge performance improvements.
            </p>

            <h3>Launch to exercise</h3>

            <p>
            I added a way to go directly to a specific exercise when launching
            the app from Xcode. A simple change, but one that saved a lot of
            time, especially when debugging issues for a specific exercise.
