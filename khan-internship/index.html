            <p>
            I spent the past summer working on the iOS team at Khan Academy.
            This post is a recap of some of the things I worked on during my
            internship.
            </p>

            <p>
            Khan Academy is
            best known for educational videos, but there are also hundreds of interactive
            math exercises students can use to practice skills
            ranging from counting to calculus. Here's what an exercise looks
            like on the website:
            </p>

            <div class="media-container center">
                <img src="img/khan-website.png" width="720" height="437">
            </div>

            <p>
            For the past few months, the mobile team has been working to bring
            these exercises to the iPad app and I got to help!
            </p>
        </section>

        <section class="clearfix">
            <h2>Related videos</h2>

            <p>
            Most exercises have related videos that the student can watch if they're stuck. My first project was to implement a native version of the related videos interface. We liked how the YouTube app lets you drag down a video to interact with other content, so that's what I started with.
            </p>

            <div class="media-container">
                <div class="media-caption big  right" style="width: 280px">
                    <p>
                    In the first prototype, the video stayed on a fixed track, using the finger's y-coordinate to interpolate the position on the track. This felt awkward on the iPad: if you didn't drag along the path, your finger's movement would become disconnected from the movement of the video.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    We also realized that always having a thumbnail on the screen would be a waste of precious pixels, especially since a lot of the thumbnails would be black rectangles with a few scribbles.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="video-player">
                    <div class="fake-ipad">
                        <video poster="img/related-videos-0.png"
                               width="384" height="512"
                               loop>
                               <source src="img/related-videos-0.mp4"
                                       type="video/mp4">
                               <source src="img/related-videos-0.webm"
                                       type="video/webm">
                        </video>
                    </div>
                    <div class="play-button"></div>
                    <div class="pause-button"></div>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>
            So we decided the video should have three states: hidden, maximized, and docked. The docked video would play the video in the corner, letting the student interact with the exercise while watching the video.
            </p>

            <div class="media-container">
                <div class="media-caption big right" style="width: 280px">
                    <p>
                    Since exercises can have multiple related videos, this version let the student swipe left and right to switch between the different videos in the maximized state.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    This prototype also allowed the video to be docked anywhere along the bottom of the screen. As we added more UI elements to the screen, we ended up pinning the docked video to the bottom right to make it more consistent.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="video-player">
                    <div class="fake-ipad">
                        <video poster="img/related-videos-free-docking.png"
                               width="384" height="512"
                               loop>
                               <source src="img/related-videos-free-docking.webm"
                                       type="video/webm">
                               <source src="img/related-videos-free-docking.mp4"
                                       type="video/mp4">
                        </video>
                    </div>
                    <div class="play-button"></div>
                    <div class="pause-button"></div>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>I spent a lot of time playing with these prototypes. I noticed that when docking the video, if your finger was not centered in the video view, the finger would become detached from the video as it shrunk, ruining the illusion of direct manipulation. I fixed it by setting the view's anchor point to the touch position, which makes the view shrink around the user's finger&mdash;a simple fix that prevents limb-view detachment. See for yourself:</p>

                        The touch leaves the view as it shrinks.

                </div>
                <div class="media-container right half">

                        After: Anchor point is set to the touch position.
                        The view resizes around the touch, so the
                        touch never leaves the view.
                    </div>
                </div>

                <div class="play-button" style="background-position-y: 200px"></div>
                <div class="pause-button" style="background-position-y: 200px"></div>
            </div>

            <p>I tried implementing all of these animations with <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIDynamicAnimator_Class/index.html#//apple_ref/occ/cl/UIDynamicAnimator">UIDynamics</a>, but ended up switching to <a href="https://github.com/facebook/pop">POP</a> because UIDynamics doesn't provide an easy way to tell when animations have quiesced and I needed to know when to pause and play the video. As a bonus, POP made it pretty easy to have the animations be <a href="http://youtu.be/OiY1cheLpmI?t=43m35s">interruptible</a>.</p>

            <p>Plot twist! Most of this didn't make it into the app. When we tested with real students, it wasn't clear that the fancy interactions were helpful. So we ended up shipping a simpler implementation for now.</p>

            <h2>Scratchpad</h2>

            <p>My next project was to make a native version of the exercise scratchpad. This ended up being my biggest project.</p>

            <p>The scratchpad is a drawing canvas, but sits in front of a web view. The web view has interactive content.</p>

            <p>The scratchpad canvas is a native view that sits on top of the web view rendering the exercise content. To complicate matters, most exercises have interactive components. Here's a video of the final scratchpad in action:</p>

                               loop>
                           <source src="img/scratchpad-full.webm"
                                   type="video/webm">
                           <source src="img/scratchpad-full.mp4"
                                   type="video/mp4">
                        </video>

                    </div>

            Hit testing in the webview attempts. e.preventDefault(). Issues with
            that. Final solution: async hit test, forward compatible when we
            switch to WKWebView.

            Two finger scrolling: human fingers are not very precise. Have to
            cancel drawing if second finger shows up within a threshold.

            <h3>UIWebView &rarr; WKWebView</h3>

            <h3>Launch to exercise</h3>

            <p>
            I added a way to go directly to a specific exercise when running
            the app from Xcode. A simple change, but one that saved a lot of
            time. Before, we would launch the app and either browse to an
            exercise (at least 5 taps) or search for an exercise (2 taps +
            5 keystrokes).
            </p>

            <p>
            It uses a custom scheme that sets an environment variable
            indicating the exercise to load on launch.
            </p>
